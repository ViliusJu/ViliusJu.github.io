              Hungary is a landlocked country in
              Central Europe. Spanning 93,030 square kilometres (35,920 sq mi) of the Carpathian Basin, it is
              bordered by Slovakia to the north, Ukraine to the northeast, Romania to the east and southeast, Serbia to
              the south, Croatia and Slovenia to the southwest, and Austria to the west. Hungary has a population of 10
              million, mostly ethnic Hungarians and a significant Romani minority. Hungarian, the official language, is
              the world's most widely spoken Uralic language, and among the few non-Indo-European languages widely
              spoken in Europe

            <p>
              The "H" in the name of Hungary (and Latin Hungaria) is most likely due to founded historical associations
              with the Huns, who had settled Hungary prior to the Avars. The rest of the word comes from the Latinized
              form of Byzantine Greek Oungroi (Οὔγγροι). The Greek name was borrowed from Old Bulgarian ągrinŭ, in turn
              borrowed from Oghur-Turkic Onogur ('ten [tribes of the] Ogurs'). Onogur was the collective name for the
              tribes who later joined the Bulgar tribal confederacy that ruled the eastern parts of Hungary after the
              Avars

                <p>Budapest, Hungary’s capital, is bisected by the River Danube. Its 19th-century Chain Bridge connects
                  the hilly Buda district with flat Pest. A funicular runs up Castle Hill to Buda’s Old Town, where the
                  Budapest History Museum traces city life from Roman times onward. Trinity Square is home to
                  13th-century Matthias Church and the turrets of the Fishermen’s Bastion, which offer sweeping views

                <p>Budapest is one of the most photogenic cities in Europe. The dramatic skyline that Budapest is most
                  famous for is peppered with 19th-century architectural wonders alongside the Danube River. Notable
                  landmarks include the majestic riverside Parliament Building and a collection of stunning basilicas.

                <p>Szeged is the third largest city of Hungary, the largest city and regional centre of the Southern
                  Great Plain and the county seat of Csongrád-Csanád county. The University of Szeged is one of the most

                <p>The name Szeged might come from an old Hungarian word for 'corner' (szeg), pointing to the turn of
                  the river Tisza that flows through the city. Others say it derives from the Hungarian word sziget
                  which means 'island'. Others still contend that szeg means 'dark blond' (sötétszőkés) – a reference to
                  the color of the water where the rivers Tisza and Maros merge</p>

                <p>When the area that is today Western Hungary was a province of the Roman Empire, a city called
                  Scarbantia stood here. Its forum was located where the main square of Sopron can be found today.

                  During the Migration Period, Scarbantia was believed to be deserted. By the time Hungarians arrived in
                  the area, it was in ruins. In the 9th–11th centuries, Hungarians strengthened the old Roman city walls
                  and built a castle. The town was named in Hungarian after a castle steward named Suprun.

                <p> In 1273, King Otakar II of Bohemia occupied the castle. Even though he took the children of Sopron's
                  nobility with him as hostages, the city opened its gates when the armies of King Ladislaus IV of
                  Hungary arrived. The king rewarded Sopron by elevating it to the rank of free royal town.</p>
